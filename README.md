# BattleArena

BattleArena is a simple, text-based battle simulation game where players take on the role of a hero fighting against an enemy in a turn-based system. Utilizing both normal attacks and special abilities, players must strategically defeat their opponents to emerge victorious.

## Features

- **Turn-Based Combat**: Decide between using a normal attack or a special ability each turn.
- **Special Abilities**: Special abilities with cooldowns add a layer of strategy to the battles.
- **Dynamic Battle Outcomes**: The outcome of each battle is determined by the choices you make and the randomness of attacks.

## How to Play

1. **Start the Game**: Run the game script to initiate a battle.
2. **Choose Your Action**: Each turn, you will be prompted to choose between a normal attack (1) or using your special ability (2). If your special ability is on cooldown, you will need to wait before using it again.
3. **Win the Battle**: Reduce your enemy's health to 0 before they do the same to you. Strategy and timing are key to victory.
